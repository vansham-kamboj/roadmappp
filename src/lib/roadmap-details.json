Understand how to use tags like `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<a>` for links, and `<img>` for images. Practice creating lists with `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`. Finally, learn about semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` to give your pages better structure and improve SEO.

Learn the box model (margin, border, padding, content). Explore positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed, sticky) and layout techniques like Flexbox and CSS Grid, which are essential for modern responsive design. A common challenge is understanding selector specificity and how the cascade works. Practice by trying to clone the layout of your favorite websites.",
